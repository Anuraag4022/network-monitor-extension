chrome extension

So I have developed one chrome extension using AI that monitor your browser traffic and detect DDOS attack, XSS attack.

for DDOs attack it checks for more than 200 requests and for xss it check for input validation.
so I yo wat to test this extension on your own machine so follow below steps.
1. Create a new folder in your computer by name of "Network_monitor_analyzer_Powered By Anurag".
2. Download background.js, icon.png , manifest.json, popup.html ,popup.js,rules.json from my repository to "Network_monitor_analyzer_Powered 
   By Anurag" this folder.
3. Open chrome extensions ensure that Developer Mode is Active .
4. click on " Load Unpacked " button > select this folder "Network_monitor_analyzer_Powered By Anurag" > Upload.
5. After successful upload of extension popup window do some malicious activity on Chrome and in result you will get corresponding alerts.

Enjoy..
